## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am Eva (like in Wall-E :dependabot:)! 

I'm a student at the University of Virginia with a passion for solving problems and an interest in data science. Follow my journey as I apply my learning to real-world challenges and projects.

ðŸŽ® When I'm not analyzing, you'll find me playing puzzle video games like Skyrim and The Talos Principle. They have both sparked and sustained my love for problem-solving. I also love to fish and cook!

ðŸš€ I'm always eager to learn new skills and collaborate on exciting projects.

ðŸŒ± Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/eva-butler/Portfolio) for all of my projects, skills, certificates, and achievements.

ðŸ’¬ Access my [Notes](https://github.com/eva-butler/Notes) repo to check out my notes on both UVA and online courses.
